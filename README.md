In this project, Three recommender systems for movies were created. The first system is popularity-based, allowing users to input a genre, minimum rating threshold, and the number of recommendations. It recommends the top movies within the specified genre, prioritizing those with higher ratings and a minimum number of reviews. The second system is content-based, where users input a movie, and the system suggests similar movies based on genres. The third system is collaborative-based, where users input a target user and the number of similar users desired. The system then recommends top movies based on the preferences of these similar users.
